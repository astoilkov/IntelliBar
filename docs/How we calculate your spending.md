# How we calculate your spending

OpenAI charges you per [token](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/tokens) (`100` tokens ~= `75` words). We count those tokens and multiple them by the price stated on the [OpenAI Pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing). `100,000` words cost around `$1`.
- `Tip:` use [OpenAI Usage](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits) for detailed information on your spending.  
- `Tip:` set limits and control your spending at [OpenAI Usage Limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits).

For each question asked, the entire chat up until now + the new question + the answer are counted up by OpenAI as tokens.
- `Tip:` keep your chats small for less spending.

The "Prompt completion" feature also uses OpenAI API and increases your token usage.
- `Tip:` disable it to lower your spending.
