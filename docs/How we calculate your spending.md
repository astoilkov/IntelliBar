# How we calculate your spending

OpenAI charges you per [token](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/tokens) (`100` tokens ~= `75` words) [^1]. We count those tokens and multiple them by the price stated on the [OpenAI Pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing).

For each question asked, the entire chat up until now + the new question + the answer are counted up by OpenAI as tokens. `Tip:` keep your chats small for less spending.

The "Prompt completion" feature also uses OpenAI API and increases your token usage. `Tip:` disable it to lower your spending.

[^1]: For example, the transcript of the US Declaration of Independence contains `1,695` tokens.
