## A tool you can trust

IntelliBar is just a UI for the ChatGPT API. Your questions go to the ChatGPT API and no one else. The only requests IntelliBar sends to our servers are to check for updates.

## From the team behind Nota

IntelliBar is made by [@erusev](https://github.com/erusev) and [@astoilkov](https://github.com/astoilkov). We've been making tools for thought for over 8 years now, with most of our effort going into our note-taking app, [Nota](https://nota.md/).
