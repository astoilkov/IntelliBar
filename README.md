## A tool you can trust

IntelliBar is just a UI for the ChatGTP API. Your questions are sent to the ChatGTP API and **no one else**. Your past conversations are stored locally on your Mac and are never sent to our servers. Your API key is stored locally and is never sent to our servers. The only requests that are sent to our servers are to check for updates.
